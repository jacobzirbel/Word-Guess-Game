# Word-Guess-Game
## Harry Potter themed word guess game.

### Gameplay:
Similar to hangman - try to correctly identify the randomly chosen words by guessing letters before running out of points. An incorrect guess loses 1 point. Points can also be used to get clues to help identify the word. Wins and losses are tracked.

Start the game by clicking the start button. Enter letters on keyboard. Each letter can only be guessed once. After finishing a game, clicking or pressing enter will restart the game with a new random word.
